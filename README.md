#AI answering distress calls and assistive technologies for the human callers#

##Objective:
Build state-of-the-art technology to predict or manage natural disasters better.

##Abstract:
Emergency relief services are flooded with distress and help calls in the event of any emergency situation. Managing such a huge amount of calls is time-consuming and expensive when done manually. The chances of a critical information being lost or unobserved is also a possibility. In such cases, AI can work as a 24/7 dispatcher. AI systems and voice assistants can analyze massive amounts of calls, determine what type of incident occurred and verify the location. They can not only interact with callers naturally and process those calls, but can also instantly transcribe and translate languages. AI systems can analyze the tone of voice for urgency, filtering redundant or less urgent calls and prioritizing them based on the emergency.

##Objectives:
1. The chatbot would be able to quickly parse the speech that the caller is saying to extract all the keywords of importance and to quickly gauge where and what has happened and to register a SOS in the name of the caller. There would be pre-defined list in the chatbot which are essentially details required to ascertain that complete information is present so that appropriate action can be taken. Also it would be able to gauge the severeness and inform the appropriate authorities.
2. Also with the ongoing activities it would automatically generate a heatmap of the tension zones and the different types of activity that are going on. Also there would be a predictive component to it so that it can predict some seasonal calamities or other things purely based on the pattern of calls and make arrangements appropriately.
3. It would be able to track the calls and also register them with the database so as to check for anomaly like fake calls etc. This is because we had looked on the statistics and got to know that an appreciable number of calls are fake ones. Also in the speech it would look for phrases which are generally used by people making fake calls or those that seem to be not in distress.
4. Also based on the incident occurring, if there is some advice that can be given to the caller like some precautions that must be taken, or to tell him to relocate and go to some other place where rescue operation is going on and other broadcasting type things, can be done by the chatbot.
5. Also a transcript will be maintained for the bot which can be changed in real-time. This would be very similar to the shush-mode developed by Google recently.
